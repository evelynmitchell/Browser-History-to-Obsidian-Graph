# Turning your Chrome History into an Obsidian Vault
This project takes your chrome history and turns it into an obsidian graph. The graph shows your sessions rather than pages, which are smartly summarized, categorized, and tagged using GPT and DBSCAN.

To use this notebook, you'll need to set a filepath to your chrome history and provide your OpenAI API key. The OpenAI API functions cost about 15c per 500 browsing sessions.

Next Steps:

- Better tagging & clustering systems
- Time-based filtering
- Bring in favorites/bookmarks?
- revisit page-based data
- more cleanup
