This project takes your chrome browser history and turns it into an obsidian graph of your browser sessions and the domains you've visited.

This notebook uses GPT to create summaries, tags, and embeddings. To use this notebook you'll need to set a filepath to your chrome history and provide your OpenAI API key. The OpenAI API functions cost about 15c per 500 sessions.

Next Steps:

- Better tagging & clustering systems
- Time-based filtering
- Bring in favorites/bookmarks?
- revisit page-based data
- more cleanup
